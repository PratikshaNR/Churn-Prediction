# **Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning**

Welcome to the Customer Churn Prediction repository!
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to predict customer churn based on behavior, demographics, and service-related features. It's ideal for data science learners, business analysts, and developers exploring real-world ML applications.



** Project Workflow **
📊 1. Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Feature scaling (StandardScaler)

Addressing class imbalance (e.g., SMOTE)

📈 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Churn vs. Non-Churn distribution
Correlation heatmap
Feature importance and visual insights

🤖 3. Model Building
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
XGBoost

✅ 4. Model Evaluation
Confusion Matrix
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
ROC Curve and AUC

🌐 5. Web Application (Flask/Streamlit)
Clean UI for inputting customer data
Displays churn prediction in real-time
Suitable for deployment or demo use
